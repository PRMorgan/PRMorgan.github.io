		<p> Welcome aboard, matey!
		<p> This site is currently under construction. But I'm guessing you could probably have figured that one out based on the total lack of content. Please come back in the future.
		<p> For now, you can peruse my Github and take a look at all of my current projects I have made public. Here's a breakdown of them.
			<ul>
				<li> AI-Kido: A fighting simulator built using Pygame and NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topoliges), which is just fancy talk to say we build a neural network that optimizes itself using a genetic algorithm. This project was built by myself and 3 friends for the Artificial Intelligence class at Truman State University.
				<li> 5e Character Creater: This is the first personal project I ever worked on with the intent of distribution. This handy tool walks you through the process of creating a character for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. It was written with my one true love, Ada95.
